# Routing in React 

Routing between views in React is the key to taking advantage of the library's powerful and selective rendering model, and most of us know how to set it up quickly with the de facto routing library known as React Router. But React Router is a double-edged sword, while quick, declarative, and readable - it often introduces breaking changes that can take some doing, and require some understanding, to resolve. 

This repo aims to explore how routing works with a third party library doing the low-level stuff for us.
